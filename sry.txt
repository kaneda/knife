Dear Kaneda-senpai,
カナダ氏。m(_ _)m
ごめんなさい。Gomen!
Tottemo gomen nasai.
Lo siento por el pasado.
No matter how many languages
I say it in, nothing can
truly phrase the deep
rift between our projects.

The truth is, I admire,
and continue to admire,
your work, as well as Kali's
and Offensive-Security.com
overall. I would truly,
really, feel a joy to
be able to work with
a man, and coder, of
such caliber as you-
rself, Josh Beguilter.

All the best,
Tom G. Hastings
